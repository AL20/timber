## Installation

If you haven't already, please read the [Installation](/docs/installation/) article. This guide assumes you installed in your theme directory and picks up where that one leave off.

### Navigate to your WordPress themes directory

Like where twentyeighteen and twentynineteen live. The Timber Starter Theme will live at the same level.

	/wp-content/themes	/twentyeighteen
				/twentynineteen
				/timber-starter-theme

You should now have:

	/wp-content/themes/timber-starter-theme

You should probably **rename** this to something better.

### 1. Select your theme in WordPress

Navigate to the Manage Themes page in your WordPress admin (Appearance => Themes). Select the **timber-starter-theme** theme from the step above (or whatever you renamed it to).

### 3. Letâ€™s write our theme!

Continue ahead in [part 2 about Theming](https://timber.github.io/docs/getting-started/theming/).
